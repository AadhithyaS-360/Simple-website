      <h2>About This Page</h2>
      <p>This is a simple webpage created using only HTML and CSS. It has a header, navigation bar, content cards, and a footer. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages on the World Wide Web. It provides the fundamental building blocks of a website, allowing developers to organize text, images, links, multimedia, and other elements into a structured format that can be displayed by web browsers. Unlike a programming language, HTML is not used to perform calculations or logic; instead, it is a markup language that defines the meaning and structure of content. Every HTML document starts with a declaration <!DOCTYPE html> and is enclosed within the <html> tag, which contains two main sections: the <head> and the <body>. The head section provides metadata such as the page title, character encoding, stylesheets, and scripts, while the body contains the visible content like text, images, and links. HTML works hand in hand with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which handles styling, and JavaScript, which manages interactivity, to create fully functional and visually appealing websites. One of the key features of HTML is its use of tags (enclosed in angle brackets) such as <p> for paragraphs, <h1> to <h6> for headings, <a> for hyperlinks, <img> for images, <div> for divisions or sections, and <span> for inline elements. Tags often come in pairs, with an opening and a closing tag, to mark the start and end of content, though some tags like <br> or <img> are self-closing. Over the years, HTML has evolved significantly, from the early versions in the 1990s to the current standard, HTML5, which introduced powerful features such as audio and video support without plugins, semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>, as well as better support for mobile-friendly and responsive design. Semantic elements in HTML5 improve not only readability of the code but also accessibility for screen readers and search engine optimization (SEO), making content more meaningful. HTML also allows embedding of external resources such as CSS stylesheets with the <link> tag and JavaScript files with the <script> tag, enabling dynamic and customized web experiences. Accessibility features like the use of alt text in images, form labels, and ARIA roles help make web content usable for people with disabilities. Since HTML is platform-independent, a document written once can be rendered on any device with a browser, from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones. Moreover, HTML documents are lightweight, text-based, and easy to learn, making it the first step for anyone entering the world of web development. As the backbone of the internet, HTML is continuously updated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and WHATWG to adapt to modern needs. In conclusion, HTML remains the essential foundation of all websites, providing the structure upon which styles and behaviors are layered. Whether it is a simple personal blog or a complex web application, HTML plays a vital role in ensuring that content is displayed in an organized, accessible, and user-friendly manner, solidifying its importance as the cornerstone of web development. </p>
