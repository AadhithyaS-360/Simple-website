        <h3>Short biography</h3>
    <p id="one">In 2013, Sivakarthikeyan appeared in three films. In his first release of the year, Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga, a dual hero coming-of-age comedy, Sivakarthikeyan partnered once again with Pandiraj and shot for the film in his hometown of Tiruchirappalli alongside Vimal.[19] The film opened to positive reviews from critics.[20][21] The film became a surprise success at the box office and ended up being a profitable venture for producers and distributors.[22] His next success was through Dhanush's debut production venture Ethir Neechal, written and directed by R. S. Durai Senthilkumar, a former assistant of film director, Vetrimaaran. It is a story about a young man having talent as a runner, who strives to make an identity for himself. His third release in 2013, director Ponram's comedy Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam, saw him portray a carefree rural youth where he paired up with another newcomer Sri Divya. Actor Soori played an important role in the film as Sivakarthikeyan's close friend. It was also the first time that Sivakarthikeyan sang a song in a film, and a promotional video of its making was released to market the film. He won positive reviews for his performance from critics, with Sify noting "Sivakarthikeyan is terrific as Bosepandi because he makes it look so believable on screen with his body language, eyes and dialogue delivery". Another reviewer called him a delight to watch and claimed that he carried the script.[23] The film completed 100 days during its theatrical run and was Sivakarthikeyan's biggest commercial box office success at that time.[24] Sivakarthikeyan's entertaining performances in 2013 led him to win the year's Vijay Award for Entertainer of the Year, an onstage moment which Sivakarthikeyan described as "memorable".[25] He started the year 2014 with a comedy film Maan Karate produced by A. R. Murugadoss. The film featured him as a carefree urban youth who fakes himself as a boxer to impress a girl.</p>
